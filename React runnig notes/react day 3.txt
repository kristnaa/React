
										hooks ?
									====================

`````````````````What are Hooks in React?

	
-> Before hooks, only class components could use things React features. Hooks make it possible to use these features in function components too!

-> Hooks are special functions in React that let you “hook into” [means To connect to something ] React features from your function components 
	  
	React feature -> like state, lifecycle methods, context, etc. use these all without writing classes using hooks.


``````````````````Commonly Used Hooks

Here are some of the most important hooks:

Hook Name	What It Does							Example Use
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
useState	Adds state to your function component				Counting clicks, toggles
useEffect	Runs code when something changes (like lifecycle methods)	Fetching data, timers
useContext	Lets you use context (global data) in your component		Theme, user info , Accesses context API
useRef		Lets you keep a mutable value that doesn’t cause re-render	Accessing DOM elements.



````````````````What Is "State"?
In React, state is a data container that holds information about the component. When the state changes, React automatically re-renders the component with the new data.

Think of it like memory that changes over time—for example, the number in a counter, the text in an input box, or the items in a shopping cart.





````````````````Example: useState and useEffect


import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}

Note  : 
------
useState -> lets you keep track of the number of clicks.

useEffect -> lets you update the page title every time the count changes.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

````````````````````What is useState?

-> In simple terms, useState lets you store and update values over time in a functional component. These values persist between re-renders of the component.


Syntax: 
------

const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

````Parameters:

initialValue: The starting value of your state (can be any data type: number, string, object, array, etc.).

````Returns:

state: The current value of the state.  //store the current value.

setState: A function to update the state. When called, it re-renders the component with the new state value.


``````````````````` Example: Counter Component

import React, { useState } from 'react';


function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // count is the state variable

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}



````````````````Explanation:


useState(0) initializes the state with the value 0.

count holds the current state value.

setCount is used to update the state.

Clicking the button calls setCount(count + 1), which updates the state and causes the component to re-render.



useEffect 
=========

for title update


useEffect(()=> {
  document.title = `you clicked like almost ${count} times`
});


Example class room code:
------------------------

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import reactLogo from './assets/react.svg'
import viteLogo from '/vite.svg'
import './App.css'
import Mydata from './components/MyData'
import Card from './components/Card'

function App() {

  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // function incCount(){
  //   return setCount(count + 1)
  // }


  useEffect(() => {

    document.title = `title changed for ${count} times`
  }

  );

  return (

    <>
      <div>
        <h2>  You clicked the button {count} times </h2>

        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}> Click here</button>


      </div>
    </>
  )
}

export default App



``````````````````````1. Reading State

-> When you use useState, it returns the current value of the state. You can use that value anywhere inside your JSX or logic.

-> previously we seen example with Number as count with inital value 0 , now we can take " some string  " 

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Greeting() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('Alice'); // Initial state: 'Alice'

  return (
    <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1> // We're reading the state here
  );
}

 ````````````````````````2. Updating State

-> You update state using the setter function returned by useState. When you call this function, React updates the state and re-renders the component.
-> use the useState code example only .

`````Array Example:

const [items, setItems] = useState([]);

setItems(prevItems => [...prevItems, 'New item']);







`````````````````````What Are User Events?

User events are interactions from the user, such as:

1.Clicking a button			(onClick)

2.Typing in a text field		(onChange)

3.Submitting a form			(onSubmit)

4.Hovering over an element

5.Pressing a key

-> React provides a way to listen for these events and respond with event handlers—just like in HTML/JavaScript, but with some differences.

1) Clicking a button
----------------------

already we have seen some use case on the above.


2) Input Event (onChange)
----------------------

import React, { useState } from "react";

function InputOnChangeEx() {

    const [name, setName] = useState('');

    function setChange(event) {

       setName(event.target.value)
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <input type="text" onChange={setChange} />
            <h2> name changed here {name} </h2>
            
        </div>
    )
}

export default InputOnChangeEx


-> use this in App.jsx after import 

`````````````event.target.value gives you the value typed in the input box.

```````````This updates the state and re-renders the UI.



```````````````````````````````````````What Is State Immutability?

Immutability means not changing the original data directly.

In React, you should never modify the state directly. Instead, create a new copy of the state and update it.



React uses shallow comparison to detect changes in state and props. If you mutate the state directly, React might not notice a change and won’t re-render your component properly.


``````````````Mutating State (Bad Practice)

const [numbers, setNumbers] = useState([1, 2, 3]);



`````````````Direct mutation (don't do this!)

numbers.push(4);
setNumbers(numbers); // React may not re-render correctly!


```````````````Immutable Update (Good Practice)

// Create a new array with the new value
setNumbers([...numbers, 4]);



State Immutability
-------------------


count = 0 ;   // mutable object


++count
count--

count = 2;
count = 5;




take one more copy of the previous element and than update there only

setCount( count + 0 ) ;
